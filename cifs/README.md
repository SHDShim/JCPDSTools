This folder is reserved for cif files and their JCPDS conversions.  

If the source cif file is accurate, the JCPDS information can be the highest quality.  
However, it is important to remember that these JCPDSs made from CIF contains much more information.
Therefore, they can reduce the performance of PeakPo.  
However, if you need high quality peak identification, these files should be the best quality.

(Tips for the CIF sources)

MaterialsProject: Make sure you download symmetrized versions.

AmericanMineralogist: I do not know why but some CIF files cause error in put.  An example is given for Tschauner bridgmanite case.
